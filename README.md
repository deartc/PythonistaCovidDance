# PythonistaCovidDance

My project was done in Pycharm. To run my project, first clone my project. My python needs to be opened in py3. It will start the program and automatically state my related email and website.  Then, it will state today's day and an anticipated exercise stop date.   The program will prompt  the user to input a value into pounds to convert them into calories.  Then, there will be a prompt to input  the calories each day of the week after the prompt.  There will then be affirmations to encourage dancers recovering from Covid and number of words in the sentences and paragraphs counted.   After the dictionary of dances run, there will be a dancing choice game.  The program will be for a dance instructor and student to select one of the dance choices.  
They can determine to continue or exit the game with a yes or no.  

My python project involves developing a fitness regimen after having Covid. I realized that coding about an exercise program after Covid totally changed how I felt about the process because I finally was researching why there were valid reasons why my body had setbacks (underreported random waves of symptoms).
Although I am an environmental quality assurance analyst, I am also a certified group fitness (AFAA and NASM certified) instructor. As someone who was training for my third marathon at the time I contracted Covid  but had difficulty walking even five minutes after Covid, I assumed I would quickly find a fitness regimen. I was shocked at the lack of information for people who have lingering symptoms and wanted to get back in shape. I wanted to use my coding project to inspire myself and others trying to get back to peak health after Covid. I chose dancing because it has the necessary emotional component (I'm certified in the Lablast ballroom fitness program) that is helpful from those trying to deal with decreased health especially when experiencing underreported random waves of negative symptoms after Covid. Dancing also has different styles with different bpm (beats per minute) and my code can also educate people on styles and the slower bpm they can utilize so they can safely exercise. 

I satisfied the following components: 

1. I built a conversion tool that satisfies the requirement of calculating and displaying data based on an external factor. I used the current date, and then displayed how many days remaining until some future date. I used a week in the future as the end date because that is a conventional time for a person to monitor exercise progress. I wanted to use that also in the second requirement (a calorie counter of burnt calories dancing.)

2. I also satisfied the requirement of creating and calling at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in the code. I determined how to calculate calories. I then calculated the calorie count for one week.


3. I put in affirming exercise messages from someone who is recovering from covid to satisfy analyzing text and determining how many words were in each motivational sentence and then the number or words in  a motivational paragraph.


  4. I satisfied the requirement of creating a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program. I created a dictionary game that listed dance styles and beats per minute. One dictionary had slower dance styles. The second dictionary had faster dance styles. I then had an intersection of the dictionaries of the more intermediate dance styles. I used the three intermediate dance styles in a game.


5. The option of selecting three dances program satisfied the requirement of implementing a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions. I created a computer generated computer game to entertain players with the this intersection of dance styles (intermediate dance styles). I asked the user  (dancer) to chose from these three dance styles. The computer (the instructor) also chose a style. The player (dancer) gets to choose if the random pick is selected as the same dance style. A yes or no option will allow for the program to continue or discontinue.
  
6.    I also built a conversion tool that satisfies a requirement that converts the user input of one type lbs to another type  (calories) because I used calories in another requirement.

7. I also implemented a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format. I used my email address and implemented a regex to ensure it was stored in same format.  

8.  I implemented a unit test for my program.  The report indicated no errors in .03 seconds.

Correct use of Git/Github and commits: I followed the correct steps in the project guidelines to create and name the github repository that would reflect a distinct repository. I then used the proper guidelines to initialize the project and add files using git bash and the command line. I then far exceeded the minimum number of commits needed to pass.
